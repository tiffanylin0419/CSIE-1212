# Magic Certification
Erina was a 19-year-old fairy who lived in the angustifolia forest. In the angustifolia forest, residents of the forest needed to obtain a magic certification before 20-year-old, or they would be expelled. Fairies invented innovative magic and perform it on the angustifolia magic assembly. Elder fairies award a magic certification if they felt satisfied with the magic invented by fairies.

For a magic certification, Erina racked her brains to create high-quality magic. However, she got a secret before the angustifolia magic assembly - Most elder fairies preferred symmetrical magic. Erina wanted to modify her magic with the lowest effort. Can you help her to convert the original magic to the shortest symmetrical magic by adding some characters in front or back of the original magic?
## Input
The input contains a string s.
## Output
You should output several lines. The first line outputs how many characters you need. Output the shortest palindrome you convert by adding characters in front or back of the original string s. If there is more than one converting method to satisfy the shortest palindrome, please print out all of them (from the most extra characters in front of the original string s to the least extra characters in front of the original string s.) You can refer the Sample Input2.
## Constraints
* 0≤thelengthofthestrings≤107
* s consists of ASCII codes from 0x21 to 0x7E only
