# Teacher Lightning Bear’s Kingdom

The Lightning Bear Kingdom is the greatest country in the world. There are N cities in the kingdom. Each city is represented by an integer between 1 and N, with city S being the capital of the kingdom. The cities are connected by roads, where each road is of unit length and connects two cities. Teacher Lightning Bear, the king of the Lightning Bear Kingdom, is the smartest person in the world. He designs the kingdom to be as simple as possible. In particular, he uses only N − 1 roads to make all cities fully connected with each other. As a consequence, there is one and only one path for any pair of cities.

Now, Teacher Lightning Bear wants to enjoy his vacation at his favorite resort which is in city R. Thunder Tigger, a dear friend of Teacher Lightning Bear, wants to find where Teacher Lightning Bear is, in order to surprise him. Thunder Tigger thus asks you, the secretary of Teacher Lightning Bear, to provide some hints. Nevertheless, Teacher Lightning Bear does not really like surprises. If he finds that you leak the resort information to Thunder Tigger, he can get angry and you will certainly be fired. As a consequence, you can only communicate with Thunder Tigger with the following protocol.


* Thunder Tigger proposes city c as the query.
* You first write down the path from c to the capital city S as

(a0 =c)→a1 →a2...→(an =S)
* You then write down the path from c to the resort city R as

(b0 =c)→b1 →b2...→(bm =R)
* Nowyoufindthelargestisuchthataj =bj forallj≤i,andreturnai (orbi,asbi =ai)
to Thunder Tigger.

Note that it is totally possible that Teacher Lightning Bear is enjoying his vacation in the capital city. That is, R = S.

Thunder Tigger, who is very eager to know where Teacher Lightning Bear is, starts bouncing across the kingdom and querying you with many different c. You thus decide to write a program to help answer the queries faster.


## Input
The first line of input contains four numbers N, Q, S, R, separated by space. They indicate the number of cities, the number of queries, the capital city, and the resort city, respectively.

Each of the next N − 1 lines contains two integers a, b, separated by space, which indicates a (bi-directional) road between city a and city b.

Each of the next Q lines contains one integer c, indicating the query from Thunder Tigger. 

## Output
For each query, print a line that contains a single integer ai, which means the answer that should be returned to Thunder Tigger.

## Constraints
* 1≤N,Q≤106
* 1≤a,b,c,S,R≤N
* All cities are connected with each other. (Equivalently, there is exactly one path for any pair of cities.)
